// Given an array of integers a, your task is to count the 
// number of pairs i and j (where 0 â‰¤ i < j < a.length), such 
// that a[i] and a[j] are digit anagrams.

// Two integers are considered to be digit anagrams if they 
// contain the same digits. In other words, one can be obtained 
// from the other by rearranging the digits (or trivially, if the numbers are equal). 
// For example, 54275 and 45572 are digit anagrams, but 321 and 782 are not (since they 
// don't contain the same digits). 220 and 22 are also not considered as digit anagrams, 
// since they don't even have the same number of digits.

// Example:
// For a = [25, 35, 872, 228, 53, 278, 872], the output should be solution(a) = 4

// There are 4 pairs of digit anagrams:

// a[1] = 35 and a[4] = 53 (i = 1 and j = 4),
// a[2] = 872 and a[5] = 278 (i = 2 and j = 5),
// a[2] = 872 and a[6] = 872 (i = 2 and j = 6),
// a[5] = 278 and a[6] = 872 (i = 5 and j = 6).
